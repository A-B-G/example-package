        ## License
        Every package uploaded to the Python Package index should include a license. The license tells users installing the package the terms under which they can use the package. See  https://choosealicense.com/ for picking a license. <br>
        
        In the LICENSE file, paste the text of the license to be used. If the License field is left blank, this means no one will be able to use the package.
        
        ## Distribution Pckages
        Generate distribution packages for the package, whch are archives uploaded to the Package Index. They can be installed with pip. <br>
        1. Ensure the latest versions of `setupttools` and `wheel` are installed:
        ```python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel```
        2. Run the following command from the same directory where setup.py is located:
        ``` python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel```
        3. Once complete, two files should be generated in the `dist` directory: <br>
        * Built Distribution, with a **.wh1** extension and 
        * Source Archive, with a **.tar.gz** extension<br>
        You should always upload a source archive and provide built archives to identify platforms that are compatible with your project.
